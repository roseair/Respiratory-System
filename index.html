<h1> Respiratory System  </h1>
<p>The respiratory system is a biological system at which the body inhales air and uses the needed oxygen for cellular respiration and exhales waste products that accumulated. The respiratory system is the network of organs and tissues that help you breathe. It includes your airways, lungs and blood vessels. The muscles that power your lungs are also part of the respiratory system.</p>

<p>The cells in a human body requires a frequent supply for oxygen to allow such cells to perform cellular respiration to produce energy and stay alive. “The lungs and respiratory system allow oxygen in the air to be taken into the body, while also letting the body get rid of carbon dioxide/ waste products to be breathed out. Without a constant supply of oxygen and a delicate balance of inhaling oxygen and releasing waste products within the body, this can cause cell death which can lead to death and or organ damage.”</p>

<p>The functions of the respiratory system include gas exchange, acid-base balance, phonation, pulmonary defense and metabolism, and the handling of bioactive materials.</p>

<h1> Route of Respiratory System  </h1>
<p>The respiratory system takes a series of step to provide you the oxygen you need and the waste products you need fo remove. </p>

<p>The respiratory system starts at either the nose or mouth where you inhale a breath of fresh air. This air travels through your pharynx where air goes through (not your larynx, that's your voice box) down into your trachea which is the windpipe where air travels to your lungs. The trachea divides into two bronchi tubes where air enters your lungs and branches into smaller bronchioles which ends with the alveoli. </p>

<p>Alveoli are tiny air sacs at which the diffusion of gases happen. Oxygen within the alveoli are brought to body cells to use by red blood cells while waste products like carbon dioxide are picked up by red blood cells and dropped off both through capillaries in the alveoli.</p>
